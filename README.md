I no longer use GitHub for hosting any of my personal creations due to my belief that the policies of Microsoft and GitHub regarding generative AI are incompatible with the aims of free software. I recommend that others also migrate the hosting of their creations away from GitHub, if at all possible.

The things that I make are now primarily hosted on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mra), which I am happy to recommend.
